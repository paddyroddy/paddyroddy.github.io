                    I am a PhD student at the

                    My PhD is in the emerging field of

                    the combination of astrophysics, astronomy, data science,
                    and machine learning.

                    My research focuses on the study of novel spherical
                    informatics techniques for studying cosmic evolution. We are
                    developing efficient, robust and principled informatics
                    techniques designed on spherical manifolds. These techniques
                    will be of considerable theoretical and practical interest
                    in their own right. We will also apply them to analyse
                    cosmological observations to better understand cosmic
                    evolution.
