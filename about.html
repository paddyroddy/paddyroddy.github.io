          Previously, I undertook my PhD at the
          <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-cdt"
            >Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science</a
          >, supervised by
          <a href="http://www.jasonmcewen.org"> Prof Jason McEwen</a>. My PhD
          was in the emerging field of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroinformatics"
            >astroinformatics</a
          >, which is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the
          combination of astrophysics, astronomy, data science, and machine
          learning. In particular, we developed a novel wavelet basis designed
          for the analysis of incomplete data on manifolds, namely the sphere.
