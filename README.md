## Deployment

To run locally: `bundle install; bundle exec jekyll serve;`

## Formatting

To install `pre-commit` hooks locally, execute `pip install pre-commit` followed
by `pre-commit --install`. This only needs to be done once per repo, and from then
on checks are made whenever committing. See steps here to enable these checks always.
