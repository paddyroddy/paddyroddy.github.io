        <p>
          I began running in 2011 in training for a local 10km and quickly
          became hooked. I am a member of
          <a href="https://thameshareandhounds.org.uk/" target="_blank"
            >Thames Hare & Hounds</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://kenilworthrunners.com/" target="_blank"
            >Kenilworth Runners</a
          >, and previously competed for
          <a href="https://cuhh.soc.srcf.net/" target="_blank"
            >Cambridge University Hare & Hounds</a
          >

          <a href="https://uclurax.com/" target="_blank"
            >UCL Athletics & Cross Country Club</a

          try to balance with working life.
